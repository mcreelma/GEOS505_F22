## Research Overview:

My research looks primarily at remote sensing in critical zone hydrology. My most recent research revolved around using convolutional neural networks to develop cloud masking algorithms for landsat 8 and sentinel 2 datasets. Scientific computing is an essential part of this work and geospatial/remote sensing work in general.


## Goals for the Course
1. Getting Experience working on a collaborative modeling project, using git as version control
2. Use interactive packages such as plotly/tableau to visualize data
3. Apply machine learning modeling techniques to our datasets
4. Write functions that automatically pull data
